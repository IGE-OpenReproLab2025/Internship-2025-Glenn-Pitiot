# Plan of the Work

This README explains the aim of each notebook:

## Observing the Dynamics of Liquid Water Percolation and Refreezing within a Natural Snowpack during the 2025 Melt Season at Col du Lautaret

- `Campaign_CdL_2024-2025_process_method.ipynb`: Explains the materials used for the campaign and the processing methods.  
- `Campaign_CdL_2024-2025_Profile_evolution.ipynb`: Provides an overview of the campaign results.

## How to Measure Liquid Water Content of Snow?

- `Comparaison-WISe-CS655.ipynb`: Shows the comparison between a promising sensor for continuous liquid water content measurement and a reference sensor using a destructive method.

## Added Value of Richardsâ€™ Equation over a Simple Bucket Scheme and Comparison with Observations

### Tools for Simulation Preparation

- `Crocus_Gapfilling_FluxAlps.ipynb`: Aims to gap-fill raw meteorological data for the forcing file.  
- `Crocus_Rawdata2ForcingFile_CdL_24_25.ipynb`: Uses gap-filled data to create the forcing file for Crocus.  
- `Crocus_initProfile_20250317.ipynb`: Creates the initial snow profile observed on 17-03-2025.

### Results

- `Crocus_Snow-depth_obs_vs_simu.ipynb`: Presents results from three simulations with different precipitation inputs to model snow height close to reality.  
- `Crocus_simResults_20250317.ipynb`: Compares two percolation schemes with different levels of complexity.
